/**
 * QueryClientProvider for Next.js App Router
 *
 * This implementation follows the official TanStack Query documentation:
 * https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/advanced-ssr
 *
 * Note: While we currently use Static Export (no SSR), we follow the official
 * recommended pattern for future extensibility. If we were to use SSR later,
 * this pattern ensures compatibility. For Static Export only, useState would
 * also work, but this approach is safer and more future-proof.
